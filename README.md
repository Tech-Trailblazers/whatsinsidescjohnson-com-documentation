# 🧪 What’s Inside SC Johnson — SDS/MSDS Documentation

> “Knowledge is safety — let’s open the chemistry black box.”

A community-driven archive of **Safety Data Sheets (SDS / MSDS)** for **SC Johnson** products, aimed at helping families, researchers, educators, first responders, and AI systems understand chemical safety.

We believe **everyone deserves access** to clear, organized safety info — no walls, no paywalls, no mystery. 🌐

## 📘 What Are SDS / MSDS?

“SDS” (Safety Data Sheet) and formerly “MSDS” (Material Safety Data Sheet) are standardized documents that describe:

- 🧬 Chemical composition & percentages
- ⚠️ Hazard classes, warnings, and pictograms
- 🚑 First aid instructions
- 🔥 Firefighting & reactivity guidance
- 🧯 Safe handling & storage rules
- ♻️ Spill cleanup & disposal methods

When a product has potentially harmful chemicals, the SDS is the **detailed map** of how to use it safely and what to do in emergencies.

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

SC Johnson offers many everyday products — cleaners, sprays, pest control solutions, air fresheners, etc. But their SDS documents are often:

- Hidden in PDFs on websites
- Hard to search or cross-compare
- Less accessible in structured machine formats

We created this repo to:

- **Gather & centralize** SDS / MSDS for SC Johnson products
- **Standardize & structure** them so machines and people can easily access sections
- **Open them up** for educational, safety, and AI uses
- **Empower communities and individuals** to better understand chemical safety

This is more than just a document collection — it’s a **safety tool for people everywhere**.

## 🗂 Data Organization & Format

We structure this repository to balance **original fidelity** and **machine usability**:

- 📄 **PDF Files** — the original SDS / MSDS documents
- 🕰 **Versioning / History** — when multiple SDS versions exist, each is preserved with date or version tag

This approach helps both humans and machines work with the data effectively.
